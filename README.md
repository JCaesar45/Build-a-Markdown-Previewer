# Markdown Previewer

## Project Objective

Build a functional Markdown Previewer app similar to this demo:  
[https://markdown-previewer.freecodecamp.rocks/](https://markdown-previewer.freecodecamp.rocks/)

The app should allow users to write GitHub-flavored Markdown text and see a live HTML preview.

---

## Technologies Allowed

- Frontend Framework: **React** (recommended), but you can also use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, SASS, Redux, or jQuery.
- External Libraries: Use the [Marked](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked) library to parse Markdown into HTML.
- Note: React 18 has known test incompatibilities; use React 17 if possible.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional frameworks like Angular or Vue are not officially supported for this project.

## User Stories

Your app must satisfy the following:

1. **Textarea Editor**  
   A textarea element with `id="editor"` must be present.

2. **Preview Element**  
   An element with `id="preview"` must be present to display rendered HTML.

3. **Live Preview**  
   When typing into the `#editor`, the `#preview` updates live to show the parsed Markdown.

4. **GitHub-Flavored Markdown Support**  
   Markdown entered in `#editor` should render as HTML in `#preview` using the Marked library.

5. **Default Content on Load**  
   When the app loads, the `#editor` should contain default Markdown that includes:  
   - H1 heading  
   - H2 subheading  
   - Link  
   - Inline code  
   - Code block  
   - List item  
   - Blockquote  
   - Image  
   - Bold text  

6. **Rendered Default Content**  
   The default Markdown must be parsed and displayed in the `#preview` on page load.

## Optional Bonus

- Support carriage returns in Markdown to render `<br>` line breaks in the preview.
